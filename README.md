# Practical Functional Programming (UL BiCS PFP) '25

This repository contains homeworks and sample source code for the BiCS PFP
course.

Some examples (mainly source code from slides in a form that you can run) are
available in [`examples/`](examples/). These will be updated/extended as
needed.

## Homeworks

There are total 3 homework assignments, with one additional "testing run" homework zero (not evaluated). See Moodle for deadlines and other metadata.

## Homework assignments (will be updated)

- [Homework 0](hw0/): "Test". The zero-th homework is not mandatory and has absolutely no impact on the final evaluation, but it is sufficiently easy to allow some free practice, check that your compiler, environment and submission methods work right, and generally see if everything will behave as expected before you risk failing the actual assignments. I'll evaluate the submissions as they come, and send you feedback in case anything in the submission seems problematic.
- [Homework 1](hw1/): "Paintbrush for Windows 3.11".
- [Homework 2](hw2/): "Expressing yourself with expressions".
- [Homework 3](hw3/): "Like agar.io but for icons".
